# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
Team Project for UC Berkeley CS 198 (Spring 2017)
- Our team examined credit card transactions by European card holders. We created machine learning
models (logistic regression, random forests, and feed-forward neural network) to classify a given
transaction as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
